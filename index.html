        <h2>What's Demon Slayer:</h2>
        <p>
          Demon Slayer is a popular anime series based on the manga of the same
          name. The story is set in a world where demons and demon slayers
          constantly fight each other. Tanjiro’s family becomes victims of those
          man-eating demons, and everyone is slaughtered except for his sister
          Nezuko who is turned into a demon. Upon meeting a mysterious
          swordsman, Tanjiro swears to become a demon slayer and find a cure for
          his cure. From then on, he trains relentlessly and gradually becomes a
          powerful slayer, all the while keeping his sister safe. The franchise
          has three seasons and one movie under its belt, with the fourth season
          currently being in production. Delve deeper to find out the meaning of
          Kimetsu no Yaiba.

        <h2>The meaning of Kimetsu no Yaiba:</h2>
        <p>
          For a good understanding of the meaning of this phrase, one must first
          understand how the Japanese language’s Kanji script works. It is a
          logographic script that borrows characters from the Chinese script. It
          was later adopted by Japanese writers. The first character, “ki” (鬼)
          in Kimetsu, can also be interpreted as “oni” (demon). The next
          character, “metsu” (滅), can be interpreted as “horobosu.” It means to
          slay or destroy. Finally, the word Yaiba (刃) refers to an edge,
          blade, or sword. Therefore, the phrase “Kimetsu no Yaiba” translates
          to “The Demon Slaying Sword.” The reason for selecting “Demon Slayer”
          as the anime’s English title is unclear, but it could be because the
          phrase is short and has a pleasant ring to it.
